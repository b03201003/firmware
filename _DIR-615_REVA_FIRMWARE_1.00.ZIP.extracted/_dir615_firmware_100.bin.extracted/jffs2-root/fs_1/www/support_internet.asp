Only change this number if instructed to by one of our Technical Support Representatives or by your ISP.<br>
   <strong><em>Connect mode select - </em></strong> Select Always-on if you would like the router to never disconnect the PPPoE session. Select Manual if you would like to control when the router is connected and disconnected from the Internet. The Connect-on-demand option allows the router to establish a connection to the Internet only when a device on your network tries to access a resource on the Internet. </p>
